# Question Generator from PDFs using LangChain, OpenAI, FastAPI, and FAISS  

This project is an **AI-powered question generator** that processes PDFs, extracts key information, and generates relevant questions using **LangChain**, **OpenAI**, and **FastAPI**. It enables users to upload documents and automatically create meaningful questions to aid in learning, assessments, or knowledge extraction.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **FastAPI Backend** â€“ Handles file uploads, processing, and API requests efficiently.  
- **FAISS Vector Store** â€“ Stores and retrieves document embeddings for better context understanding.  
- **LangChain Pipeline** â€“ Processes text and structures question generation workflows.  
- **OpenAI API** â€“ Generates high-quality, context-aware questions from the extracted text.  
- **PDF Upload & Parsing** â€“ Supports document uploads, extracts content, and processes information for question generation.  
- **Automated Question Generation** â€“ Converts document content into well-structured questions for assessments and study purposes.  

## ðŸ”§ How It Works  
1. **PDF Upload** â€“ Users upload a PDF, which is parsed to extract textual content.  
2. **Document Processing** â€“ The extracted text is embedded and stored in FAISS for efficient retrieval.  
3. **Question Generation** â€“ LangChain processes the retrieved content and uses OpenAI to generate relevant questions.  
4. **API Response** â€“ The generated questions are returned via a FastAPI endpoint for further use.  

This project is ideal for **educational tools, AI-driven assessments, and knowledge extraction from documents.** ðŸ“šðŸ¤–ðŸš€
